# Extra Practice Statistics Labs and Walkthroughs
---
Welcome to Statistics (Again)!

(NB: there are no assignment submissions for this repository; this is for you to practice to improve.)

### Overview 
---
In this repository, you can find all the class labs we've done along with many more practice problems and walkthroughs. In particular: you can work with stochastic simulations, regression modeling, and residual plots, along with many other concepts we covered in lecture videos but did not have time to apply in our live classes. Work through as many of these notebooks as you can before your next module, and come back to these examples for ideas and starting points as you work through the statistics and EDA components of your capstone projects.

Some of the labs in the main branch do not require any questions to be solved, meaning they already contain the solutions in them labs themselves. For a few of the labs that require you to solve problems in cells inside them, you can find solutions in the "solutions" branch.
