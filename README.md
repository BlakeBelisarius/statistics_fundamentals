# Statistics Fundamentals Repository

Welcome to the **Descriptive Statistics** repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for exploring fundamental concepts in statistics, including types of data, probability, relationships, and visualization techniques. It contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks, Python scripts, and accompanying visual outputs designed to guide users through the essential building blocks of data analysis.

## Contents

This repository covers a range of topics related to **Descriptive Statistics**, organized into several sections:

### 1. Types of Data: Categorical & Quantitative
In this section, we explore the distinction between different types of data:
- **Categorical Data**: Data that represents distinct categories or groups.
- **Quantitative Data**: Data that represents numerical values and allows for mathematical operations.

Learn how to properly identify and categorize different data types for more effective analysis.

### 2. Displaying & Describing Data
Effective data analysis begins with understanding how to visualize and summarize data. In this section, we provide:
- Visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, and box plots.
- Summary statistics, including measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of spread (range, variance, standard deviation).

These tools help describe the shape, center, and variability of your data.

### 3. Common Distributions & Their Properties
Here, we introduce several commonly encountered statistical distributions, such as:
- **Normal Distribution**: The bell curve, essential for many statistical tests.
- **Binomial Distribution**: Models the number of successes in a sequence of independent experiments.
- **Poisson Distribution**: Useful for modeling rare events.

You’ll learn about their properties and when to use them in real-world scenarios.

### 4. Relationships: Scatterplots, Correlation & Simple Regression
This section focuses on methods for identifying relationships between two variables:
- **Scatterplots**: Visualize the relationship between two quantitative variables.
- **Correlation**: Measure the strength and direction of a linear relationship.
- **Simple Regression**: Model and predict the relationship between variables using linear regression techniques.

### 5. Experimental Design & Causation
Designing an experiment to test hypotheses and establish causality is a critical component of statistics. In this section, we discuss:
- **Confounding Variables**
- **Random Assignment**
- **Control Groups**

You'll gain insights into the principles of experimental design that help avoid biases and misinterpretations.

### 6. Sampling Techniques
Sampling methods play a vital role in data collection. This section highlights:
- **Uniform Sampling**: Every unit has an equal chance of being selected.
- **Stratified Sampling**: Dividing a population into strata and sampling from each stratum proportionally.

Understanding these techniques ensures accurate representation and reliable conclusions from your data.

### 7. Probability: Rules, Randomness, & Simulations
Probability is the foundation of inferential statistics. Here we explore:
- **Probability Rules**: Including addition, multiplication, and conditional probability.
- **Randomness & Simulations**: Simulating real-world phenomena to understand randomness and variability.
  
You'll find Python simulations that demonstrate these concepts through practical examples.

## How to Use This Repository

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Each topic is explained through detailed notebooks with code examples, visualizations, and explanations.
