# Interpretation:
"""
The Exponential Distribution models the time between independent events happening at a constant rate.
For example, it could represent the time between arrivals of buses at a station or the time between phone calls at a call center.

Explanation:
-Exponential Distribution: It models the waiting time between successive events in a Poisson process, like waiting for a bus or phone calls arriving at a call center.
-Lambda (位): The rate parameter controls how quickly events happen. A smaller 位 means longer waiting times, while a larger 位 means shorter waiting times.

Practical Example:
-If you're working in a setting like network traffic management, where events like packet arrivals follow a Poisson process, 
the Exponential Distribution is used to model the time between incoming packets.
